# Modelling-Fabrication-Analysis-of-Articulated-Robotic-Arm
This project presents the modeling, fabrication, and analysis of an articulated robotic arm designed for precise motion and load handling. Using mechanical modeling and prototype fabrication, the arm’s performance, accuracy, and stability are evaluated for practical automation applications.
